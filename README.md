# fgslogs
Java Swing application for opening FGS well data (lithography) files

fgslogs is a replacement for the DOS-based LITHPROG.EXE program (available from the Florida Department of Environmental Protection at http://www.dep.state.fl.us/geology/gisdatamaps/litholog-temp.htm) that can run on most platforms (supported by a JRE). 

Program Input
The FGS well data is located in multiple ZIP files on an FDEP website (http://publicfiles.dep.state.fl.us/FGS/WEB/lithologic/) and must be downloaded and unzipped in order to be opened by this program. Unlike the original LITHPROG.EXE, which required the unzipped DAT files to be located in a specific directory on the C:\ root directory, the files can exist in any folder on the computer.

Program Output
In the initial version of this program, the output data will maintain close fidelity with the output of the LITHPROG.EXE program. Future versions of this program will take some liberty and explore better visualization of the data.
